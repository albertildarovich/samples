#### Demonstration project.

Project currently not working without an API and has only code demonstration and project structuring purposes.
Project is based on davezuko starter-kit. Check out https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit

## Features
* [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)
* [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
* [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
* [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
* [karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma)
* [eslint](http://eslint.org)

## Requirements
* node `^4.5.0`
* yarn `^0.17.0` or npm `^3.0.0`

### Install from source

First, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/alexblacksnow/samples.git <my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

Then install dependencies and check to see it works. It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic installs, but `npm install` will work just as well.

```bash
$ yarn install    # Install project dependencies
$ yarn start      # Compile and launch (same as `npm start`)
```
If everything works, you should see the following:

## Application Structure

The application structure presented in this boilerplate is **fractal**, where functionality is grouped primarily by feature rather than file type. Please note, however, that this structure is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. That said, it aims to represent generally accepted guidelines and patterns for building scalable applications. If you wish to read more about this pattern, please check out this [awesome writeup](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/wiki/Fractal-Project-Structure) by [Justin Greenberg](https://github.com/justingreenberg).
